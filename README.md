# World-Weather-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this module was to help the "PLANMYTRIP" company to collect and filter customer search data to present them with the best hotel that suits their tastes. The Pandas library was used to filter and save the cities in a Jupyter Notebook database to later graph and create trend lines for the climates of the cities, these cities were also mapped with all their characteristics using the google maps API to present them to customers.
For this challenge, a few changes were made to the application to improve it and take it to the next level. The first change was to add a description of the weather to the weather data that had already been retrieved. The second change was adding input statements to filter data based on customers' preferred climates, to identify nearby hotels. Finally, with the help of Google Maps Directions api, an itinerary was created with the route of 4 cities chosen by the client.
